Dear {0} Hiring Team,

I am excited to have found your open position for a {1}.
I have recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a BS in computer science and am incredibly interested in the projects at {0} and this opportunity.
I have had a persistent interest in {2} and I would relish the opportunity to professionally contribute to {3}.
I greatly enjoy modeling problems and engineering their solutions.
Data fragmentation is a problem I've regularly encountered in both my personal and professional life.
I would relish the opportunity to contribute to an enterprise platform solution to this problem.
The chance to make contributions to these systems makes this position too enticing to ignore.

In the last year I have worked on a number of projects, both in school and on my own, which have given me the experience to comfortably prototype quickly with Python and operate in a Linux/Unix environment.
Through schoolwork and personal projects I have developed {4}.
In another class I worked with a team of four to build a distributed key-value store with replication and sharding in Docker.
In this group I gained experience designing a REST API and leveraged my experience as a manager to confidently lead and structure the project.
In the last year I have taken multiple classes based in C and Python and feel quite comfortable in both languages.
In my last quarter before graduating, I designed a system to parse data from scanned grocery receipts and worked with a team to present aggregated data and create a graphical frontend for streamlining error correction in the image OCR process.
I have some experience programming with C++ and Java as well.
This second class was also an opportunity to learn about distributed algorithms for computation and consensus.
I enjoy taking complex problems apart and working through their solutions in a collaborative social setting.
In a personal project I worked with the Youtube API to collect all video IDs from a set of channels and play them through a customized web interface.
This project gave me familiarity designing a project around an intuitive user experience.

Since graduating I have been continuing to apply this process to my everyday problems, learning new platforms and frameworks on the way.
I most recently wrote a python script for deduplicating data over a several personal device backups in preparation for setting up a proper backup server.
This has given me increased comfort working in a remote Linux environment and spurred me to learn efficient ways of comparing and representing the differences between large sets of data.
I {} recently learned the basics of Selenium to automate a complicated search pattern: finding nearby compatible car wheels across multiple makes.
I am currently also building a digital synthesizer on the Arduino platform, gaining experience with physical circuit design and optimizing code for an embedded system.
{} rewriting parts of an Arduino library to support I2C-like data transmission without calling delay functions. This project has given me experience with an embedded C++ environment and integrating new functionality into an existing interface.
Currently I am working with the WebExtensions API to provide an external unified representation of active windows, bookmarks, and the associated browsing history in emacs org-mode.

I am very excited for more opportunities to continue learning and working with a team of dedicated individuals. Thank you for reviewing my application and I hope to schedule an interview with you soon.

Sincerely,
Calvin Houser'''
