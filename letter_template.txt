This is a template for generating a form letter, perhaps another written document.
Each line in this template can be enabled or disabled, default behavior can be saved while running the generator.
Line toggling is organized by paragraph. Leave an extra blank line to separate paragraphs.
Each line break immediately after a period will be removed in the final letter.

This {0} is field zero, specified in letter_fields.json. Its content is determined while running the generator.
Optionally, values can be saved in letter_fields.json and selected between for each field like this: {2}.
However, you can always add new options to a field while running the generator.
Fields can be repeated in the template (like here {0}) and do not need to occur in the order of their indicies.
You will only be prompted to fill fields on enabled lines. If you disable this line you will not need to customize {1}
